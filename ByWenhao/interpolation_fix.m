% this function fixes the problem in recognizing the cathodes of battery
% cell 5, in some cases, the first cathode on the top is in the lower 
% position than the second or third cathode, which result in a wrong
% cathode recognition, to fix this problem, we manually adjust the position
% of the first cathode(also the longest cathode in the image).

%the detail of this problem is described in the Document.ppt.
